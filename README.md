# Torch Answer
This project was based on a popular game for android called "Logic Master". After having some problems getting past the torch board, instead of looking the answer up online, I thought 'Hey, I should write a app that solves the puzzel.' And here it is.

First I wrote out the rules that needed to be followed in plain words.
Next I replaced those sentences with relevant code.
Next I tested and corrected...rinse and repeat until it worked.
